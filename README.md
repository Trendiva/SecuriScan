## Usage

To use SecuriScan, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open your terminal**.
2. **Navigate to the SecuriScan directory**.
3. **Run the scan**:

   ```bash
   python securescan.py <target_url>
   ```

   Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the website you want to scan.

4. **Review the report**: After the scan completes, you will receive a report detailing any vulnerabilities found.

### Example

To scan a website, use:

```bash
python securescan.py https://example.com
```

This command will initiate the scan on `https://example.com` and provide a report of any issues detected.

## How It Works

SecuriScan employs various techniques to identify vulnerabilities:

1. **Library Checks**: It verifies the versions of libraries used on the website. If a library is outdated, it will flag it as a potential risk.

2. **Admin Panel Detection**: The tool scans for common admin panel paths to check if they are exposed.

3. **Security Headers**: It checks for essential security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Content-Type-Options.

4. **Vulnerability Tests**: The tool runs specific tests for vulnerabilities such as CSRF, XSS, and SQL Injection.

5. **Reporting**: After the scan, SecuriScan generates a detailed report, summarizing the findings and suggesting possible fixes.
