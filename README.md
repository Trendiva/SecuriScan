# Cybersecurity Tool

This Python tool scans websites for common cybersecurity vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It checks for:

- Outdated libraries
- Exposed admin panels
- Missing security headers
- Advanced vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, Directory Traversal)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Usage

Run the script using Python and provide the URL you want to scan.

```bash
python cybersecurity_tool.py
```

## Enhancements

- Local environment detection (skips certain checks for localhost).
- Retry logic for failed requests.
- AI-driven vulnerability detection (XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF).
